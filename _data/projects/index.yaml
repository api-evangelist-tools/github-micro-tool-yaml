    with websites, on Amazon S3, and Flickr. I'm working to centrally organize them,
    and standardize how I use across my sites. This is a lesser priority for me, so
    it has a lot of work to be done yet.

    Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate the 1000's of
    screenshots I need to make my network function. After test driving several image
    libraries I settled in with PhantomJS, which allows me to load and manipulate
    web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state.
    I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP. Once I had the
    API deployed I wrapped with my 3Scale API management infrastructure, which requires
    an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and
    news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.
